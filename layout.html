                                    <p> Bali is part of the Coral Triangle, the area with the highest biodiversity
                                        of marine
                                        species, especially fish and turtles. In this area alone, over 500
                                        reef-building
                                        coral species can be found. For comparison, this is about seven times as
                                        many as in
                                        the
                                        entire Caribbean. Bali is the home of the Subak irrigation system, a UNESCO
                                        World
                                        Heritage Site. It is also home to a unified confederation of kingdoms
                                        composed of 10
                                        traditional royal Balinese houses, each house ruling a specific geographic
                                        area. The
                                        confederation is the successor of the Bali Kingdom. The royal houses are not
                                        recognised
                                        by the government of Indonesia; however, they originated before Dutch
                                        colonisation.
