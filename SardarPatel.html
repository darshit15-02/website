        <h1 style="text-align: center; color: green; border: 2px solid black; background-color: white">Leadership Style of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel </h1>
        <p style="text-align: left;"> <b>Sardar Patel</b>  was one of the leading figures in the country during the Indian freedom movement. Besides contributing a lot to the freedom struggle of India, he also served as the Deputy <mark>Prime Minister </mark> and <mark>Home Minister</mark>  during the first three years of Indian Independence after <i>1947</i> . He was a dignified personality and a unique symbol of integration who truly understood the significance of <q>Unity is Strength</q>.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center; color: green; border: 2px solid black; background-color: white">Early life and career</h1>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Patel travelled to attend schools in Nadiad, Petlad, and Borsad, living self-sufficiently with other boys. He reputedly cultivated a stoic character. A popular anecdote recounts that he lanced his own painful boil without hesitation, even as the barber charged with doing it trembled. When Patel passed his matriculation at the relatively late age of 22, he was generally regarded by his elders as an unambitious man destined for a commonplace job. Patel himself, though, harboured a plan to study to become a lawyer, work and save funds, travel to England, and become a barrister.Patel spent years away from his family, studying on his own with books borrowed from other lawyers, passing his examinations within two years. Fetching his wife Jhaverba from her parents' home, Patel set up his household in Godhra and was called to the bar. During the many years it took him to save money, Patel now an advocate earned a reputation as a fierce and skilled lawyer. The couple had a daughter, Maniben, in (1903) and a son, Dahyabhai, in (1905). Patel also cared for a friend suffering from the Bubonic plague when it swept across Gujarat. When Patel himself came down with the disease, he immediately sent his family to safety, left his home, and moved into an isolated house in Nadiad (by other accounts, Patel spent this time in a dilapidated temple); there, he recovered slowly.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center; color: green; border: 2px solid black; background-color: white">Political philosophy</h1>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Patel, however, was no revolutionary. In the crucial debate over the objectives of the Indian National Congress during the years 1928 to 1931, Patel believed <mark>(like Gandhi and Motilal Nehru, but unlike Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose)</mark> that the goal of the Indian National Congress should be dominion status within the British Commonwealthâ€”not independence. In contrast to Jawaharlal Nehru, who condoned violence in the struggle for independence, Patel ruled out armed revolution, not on moral but on practical grounds. Patel held that it would be abortive and would entail severe repression. Patel, like Gandhi, saw advantages in the future participation of a free India in a British Commonwealth, provided that India was admitted as an equal member. He emphasized the need to foster Indian self-reliance and self-confidence, but, unlike Gandhi, he did not regard Hindu-Muslim unity as a prerequisite for independence.</p>
